        <h3>Setting the Foundation</h3>
        <p>The first two weeks were critical for establishing the project framework and assembling the right team. We needed a diverse group of designers, strategists, and technologists to tackle WEX's complex challenges.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Activities</h3>
        <p>I personally interviewed and selected 8 team members, ensuring we had expertise in automotive technology, AI/ML applications, and enterprise UX. We established our collaboration tools, defined roles, and created our project charter.</p>
        
        <h3>Strategic Alignment</h3>
        <p>Critical stakeholder meetings with WEX leadership helped us understand not just the brief, but the underlying business pressures. Fleet electrification wasn't just a trend‚Äîit was an existential threat to their gallon-based revenue model.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Deep Market Analysis</h3>
        <p>We conducted extensive research into the fleet management ecosystem, interviewing fleet managers, drivers, and technology providers. The landscape was more complex than we initially understood.</p>
        
        <h3>Competitive Intelligence</h3>
        <p>SaaS startups were eating WEX's lunch with better user experiences. We analyzed 15+ competitors and identified key UX patterns that were becoming table stakes in this market.</p>
        
        <h3>Concept Development</h3>
        <p>Our team generated over 40 initial concepts, which we rapidly prototyped and tested. Three core themes emerged that would shape our final recommendations: predictive intelligence, unified experiences, and ecosystem integration.</p>

        <h3>Collaborative Design Sessions</h3>
        <p>I facilitated intensive design workshops with both our team and WEX stakeholders. These weren't typical brainstorming sessions‚Äîwe used structured design thinking methodologies to tackle complex problems systematically.</p>
        
        <h3>Stakeholder Alignment</h3>
        <p>Getting buy-in from WEX's diverse stakeholder groups was challenging. I ran separate sessions for technical teams, business stakeholders, and the C-suite, tailoring our approach and language for each audience.</p>
        
        <h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
        <p>We built working prototypes during the workshops, allowing stakeholders to experience our concepts firsthand. This hands-on approach was crucial for getting everyone aligned on the vision.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Design System Creation</h3>
        <p>I led the creation of a comprehensive design system that could scale across WEX's diverse product portfolio. This wasn't just UI components‚Äîwe defined interaction patterns, data visualization standards, and AI integration guidelines.</p>
        
        <h3>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
        <p>Our team created pixel-perfect prototypes for three key scenarios: 2025 incremental improvements, 2027 transformational changes, and 2030 visionary concepts. Each prototype was fully interactive and data-driven.</p>
        
        <h3>Technical Feasibility</h3>
        <p>Working closely with WEX's engineering teams, I ensured our designs were not just beautiful, but technically achievable within their existing infrastructure constraints.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Stakeholder Presentation Strategy</h3>
        <p>I crafted different presentation narratives for different audiences‚Äîtechnical details for the engineering team, business impact for executives, and user experience highlights for the product team.</p>
        
        <h3>C-Suite Presentation</h3>
        <p>The final presentation to WEX's C-suite was the culmination of 10 weeks of intensive work. I presented our recommendations with confidence, backed by research, prototypes, and a clear implementation roadmap.</p>
        
        <h3>Securing Buy-in</h3>
        <p>The presentation was so well-received that WEX immediately pivoted their roadmap priorities, asking us to develop an MVP for their highest-profile dashboard. This wasn't just a design win‚Äîit was a business transformation.</p>
