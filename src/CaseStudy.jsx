        <p>The clients threw a ton of documents at us. Alongside the strategists, I dove into marking those up for insights and opportunities.I led stakeholder interviews with commercial teams, designers, and other clients.</p>
      
        <h3>Concept Generation</h3>

        <h3>Workshop Planning</h3>
        <p>With just three weeks from kickoff to client workshop, we needed to be laser-focused on what we would be doing in the room and work backwards. Based on past experience, I suggested the framework for organizing our ideas that we could iterate against and take with us.</p>
      
        <h3>Workshop Facilitation</h3>
        <p>We presented two sets of ideas: one for fleet managers and one for drivers.
          The lead strategist and I tag-teamed our presentation. My part was to paint an inspiring picture of the possibilities and to represent the real needs being met by our concepts.
          We led the clients through down-selecting our ideas, and I led an exercise to imagine a narrative that could stitch them all together into prototype.</p>

        <h3>Story briefing</h3>
        <p>An outcome of the workshop, aside from a short-list of concepts, was a pair of narratives for our prototypes.
          I synthesized the artifacts I had co-created with the clients into a comprehensive visual brief for the design team to build from.</p>

        <h3>Creative leadership</h3>
        <p>We had three weeks to complete our work. Under such pressure, all aspects of the creative process can surge at different times. Are people creating create work? Are they collaborating at their best? Problems big and small come up during this time that require empathy, listening, decisiveness, and a little humor to achieve success.</p>

        <h3>Client demos</h3>
        <p>I presented all our work to the clients, making me uniquely responsible for understanding all the intentions of the designs and the decision-making to highlight.
          I‚Äôm proud of the response I received to these demos. In addition,  we learned a little each time to respond to for the next round.</p>

        <p>The final presentation to WEX's C-suite was the culmination of 10 weeks of intensive work. I presented our recommendations with confidence, backed by research, prototypes, and a clear implementation roadmap.</p>
        
        <h3>Securing Buy-in</h3>
        <p>The presentation was so well-received that WEX immediately pivoted their roadmap priorities, asking us to develop an MVP for their highest-profile dashboard. This wasn't just a design win‚Äîit was a business transformation.</p>
